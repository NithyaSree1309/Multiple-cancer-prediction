<!--Title of the Project-->
Introducing a cutting-edge Multi-Cancer Prediction System, combining machine learning and image analysis technologies to revolutionize early cancer detection and classification.

## About
<!--Detailed Description about the project-->
This project aims to develop a sophisticated system for the early detection, classification, and prognosis of multiple cancer types using machine learning (ML) and image analysis techniques. Leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and multi-modal imaging data such as MRI, CT scans, and X-rays, the system enhances diagnostic accuracy and facilitates prompt treatment decisions. Security measures are implemented to protect patient data, while a user-friendly interface ensures accessibility for healthcare professionals.

## Features
<!--List the features of the project as shown below-->
- Early Cancer Detection: Utilizes CNNs to accurately detect and classify various cancer types from medical imaging data.
-Multi-Modal Image Analysis: Incorporates diverse imaging modalities to provide a comprehensive view of cancerous lesions.
-Real-Time Processing: Enables prompt analysis and diagnosis for faster treatment planning.
-Security Measures: Implements encryption, secure storage, and access controls to protect patient data.
